<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Soccer-Twos Installation

On a Python 3.6+ environment, run:

`pip install soccer-twos`

### MPE Installation

 Using CUDA == 10.1. For non-GPU & other CUDA version installation, please refer to the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

``` Bash
# create conda environment
conda create -n marl python==3.6.1
conda activate marl
pip install torch==1.5.1+cu101 torchvision==0.6.1+cu101 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```

```
# install on-policy package
cd on-policy
pip install -e .
```

The provided requirement.txt may have redundancy. 

``` Bash
# install this package first
pip install seaborn
```

### Soccer-Twos Training

Run the run_soccer_twos_main.py found under soccer-twos-working\mappo-competitive-reinforcement\run_soccer_twos_main.py

Modify the sample dropout delta, use_sd, use_PSRO elements as needed

### MPE Train
Here we use train_mpe.sh as an example:
```
cd onpolicy/scripts
chmod +x ./train_mpe.sh
./train_mpe.sh
```
Local results are stored in subfold scripts/results.
